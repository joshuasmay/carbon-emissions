In the GHG emissions table, kg CO2e is a sum of emissions from CO2,  CH4 and N2O. We want to use kgCO2e/mile or km(to be discussed) total, the first column. There are values for diesel and petrol.

There are notes available on each type of car. This could be added as a layer of granularity. I will add these as a separate csv for now.
